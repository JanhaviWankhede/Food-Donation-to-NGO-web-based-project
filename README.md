The "Food Donation to NGO" project is designed to connect donors with NGOs in need of food supplies. The platform allows individuals or organizations to donate surplus food, which is then distributed to NGOs that serve communities in need. The goal is to facilitate the efficient transfer of food resources, ensuring minimal food wastage and maximizing social impact.
